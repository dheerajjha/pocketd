///
/// One tool with a verb rather than three tools, and the reason is measured

/// — rebuilding the set costs a reload of the weights, which is why the
/// per-question router in `CapabilityBudget` has never had a caller — so every
/// tool is charged against every prompt for as long as the model is resident.
/// Against the default 4,096-token window, a third of which may go on schemas,
/// and a tool-native template like Qwen3's that renders them twice, three read
/// tools cost 785 tokens of a 1,344 ceiling and three more write tools take the
/// total to 1,469. That does not fit, and the budget's response to not fitting
/// is to drop tools by priority — so the writes would have been registered,
/// charged for, and then silently discarded on the exact default configuration
/// most people run. Folding the verb in costs 581 characters where three
/// separate tools cost 948.
